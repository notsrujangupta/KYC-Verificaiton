# KYC-Verificaiton
trying to make an automated KYC Verification method

This is purely a proof of concept at best. "Face_Matching.ipynb" is specifically for helping the user take a selfie to help in authorisation.

Something similar will need to be done for videos and for document images, though it is possible to make a non AI-related ML model that works for the text sections because the scope of the details is relatively limited. Will need further research.
